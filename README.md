# ⛧ Mezzage — Private Messenger on Zcash

**Mezzage** is an open-source, privacy-first messenger built on **Zcash**, designed for secure peer-to-peer communication using zero-knowledge technology.

Our goal is to make private, encrypted messaging **accessible**, **transparent**, and **accountable** — without sacrificing anonymity.

## 🌒 Overview

- 🔐 **End-to-end encrypted** communication  
- 💬 **Wallet-to-wallet messaging** on Zcash  
- 🧩 **Open-source relay** and lightweight front-end  
- ⚙️ **Built publicly** during the [Zypherpunk Hackathon](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ZypherpunkHackathon)  
- ⚡ Powered by **$ZEC**

## 🧱 Architecture

```
User ↔ Zcash Shielded Address ↔ Mezzage Relay ↔ Recipient
```

- Messages are encrypted locally and relayed via a minimal, trustless layer.  
- No centralized data storage.  
- No user identifiers beyond wallet addresses.

## 🧪 Proof of Dev

To warm up for the hackathon, we built a **Zcash message relay** and basic **frontend prototype** in just a few hours — proving our speed and intent to ship fast and clean.

## 🕶️ Philosophy

> Privacy isn’t about hiding.  
> It’s about the freedom to choose what you reveal.

We believe in open development, anonymous contribution, and verifiable progress — not empty promises.
